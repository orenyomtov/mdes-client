During this handshake, the client server can request TLS client authentication. Mastercard will present a client certificate which identifies as ?ws.mastercard.com? This client certificate is issued by the Entrust L1K certificate and should be available in most trust stores.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; __Conditional Objects__&lt;br&gt; The contents of the notifyTokenUpdated API will vary depending which of the above scneraios triggered the notification. &lt;br&gt;   1. *productConfig* - Provided when Product Configuration has changed (e.g. such as card art).      2. *tokenInfo* - Provided when either the details of the token or associated FPAN have changed (such as token or PAN expiry).      The optional objects will always contain a minimum set of data which be returned regardless of whether or not updates have been made. These fields are denoted as required fields.&lt;br&gt;
